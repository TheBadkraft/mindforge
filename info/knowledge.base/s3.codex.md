### **Section 3: Codex Documentation**

Part 1: Overview and Descriptions

Overview:
The Codex of Sigma language definition format is designed to offer a structured and extensible approach to defining programming languages. Its uniqueness lies in:
Modularity: Through the Include directive, users can compose languages from reusable, modular components, simplifying maintenance and fostering reuse.
Simplicity and Readability: It balances expressiveness with simplicity for ease of use, making it accessible even for those not deeply versed in language design.
Toolchain Compatibility: Ensures that language definitions are compatible with the MindForge toolchain, allowing for seamless parsing and compilation.
Versioning and History: Codex files include headers for tracking the evolution of the language.
Flexibility: Designed to accommodate both simple and complex language definitions.
Standard Header:
codex
## !tc_compatibility
## 
## Codex: [LanguageName]
## Release: [ReleaseName]
## Version: [VersionNumber]
## Include: ["FileName.codex", ...]
##//

!tc_compatibility: Ensures compatibility with the MindForge toolchain.
LanguageName: The name of the defined or extended language.
ReleaseName: A codename or identifier for the release.
VersionNumber: Tracks the evolution of the language in a major.minor.patch format.
Include: Specifies additional Codex files to be merged into the current definition.

Part 2: Rules, Declarations, and Samples

Rules:
Declarations: 
codex
<declaration> := <type> <identifier> ["=" <expression>]
Types: 
codex
<type> := "int" | "float" | "string" | "bool"
Expressions: 
codex
<expression> := <literal> | <identifier> | <unary_operator> <expression> | 
                <expression> <operator> <expression> | "(" <expression> ")"
Lexical Elements:
Identifier: 
codex
<identifier> := <letter> | "_" { <letter> | <digit> | "_" }
Letter: 
codex
<letter> := "a".."z" | "A".."Z"
Digit: 
codex
<digit> := "0".."9"
Including Other Codex Files:
To merge rules from other files, the following syntax is used:
codex
## Include: ["FileName1.codex", "FileName2.codex"]

This structure promotes modularity and reusability in language definition, allowing developers to construct complex languages by assembling simpler, pre-defined components.

This section provides developers with the necessary information to understand and utilize the Codex format for defining and extending programming languages within the Codex of Sigma system.
